## Overview

The second project is to **build a full-stack RESTful application** that includes **authentication**.

You'll be **building an Express application** that has a **Mongo** database using the **Mongoose ORM**.

## OPTION 1 - BLOGGING PLATFORM

You should create a blogging platform (think [Medium] (https://medium.com/)) that meets the following minimum criteria:

### MVP

* Has a User model and user authentication.
* Has a Posts model for user blog posts.
* Allow users can create, edit and delete blog posts.
* Users can only comment when logged in.
* Users can only delete their own posts.
* Is styled with Bulma, but doesn't look like Bulma.

### Extras

* Comments must be moderated before being displayed.
* Lets users create blog posts using Markdown styling.
* Any other features you want!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** – one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app.
* **Incude relationships** - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
* **The app should include authentication** - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Tips

* Use your notes in the GitBook.
* Look at similar sites online (Medium, Tripadvisor, Instagram) for inspiration.
* Check out the [CheeseBored] (https://cheesebored.herokuapp.com/) app, which is an authenticated RESTful app built with Express.
