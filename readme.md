### Process


  * Setting up Node JS and all packages
  * Coding the structure of the views with html
  * Searched online for the icons, images
  * Create links
  * Styling with CSS, Bulma    
  * Testing and fixing bugs all along


### Challenges

The back-end part was pretty challenging. Set up of Node JS and all the "connections" between routers and controllers and fixing errors.
A lot more files to manage.

### Wins

I enjoyed styling the app, managed to solve many bugs.
I gained a better understanding of node, mvc and how the different views display, so as Bulma framework.
I'm happy I managed to create the responsive navbar ("burger menu").


## Future features

I would like to add these missing features:
    * Like button
    * User's page
    * Add a profile picture to users.
    * Use File stack to upload pics
    * "Share" to FB, Twitter etc.. features
